## Features

- **Unique Chess Pieces**: Each piece has special abilities, transforming traditional chess strategies.
  - **Imp (I)**: Moves 1 square in any direction or jumps over other pieces (like a frog) for up to 7 tiles.
  - **Shield (S)**: Moves 1 square in any direction and protects adjacent squares.
  - **Archer (A)**: Moves 1 square in any direction and attacks pieces 2 tiles away.
  - **Phoenix (P)**: Moves like a queen. If captured, it rebirths once the tile it was captured on becomes empty.
  - **King (K)**: Moves 1 square in any direction. The game ends if the king is captured.
  - **Pawn (P)**: Moves 1 in any direction, or 2 squares forward if there are no pieces directly in front of it.

- **No Check or Mate**: The game focuses on strategic placement and elimination rather than traditional check and mate.
